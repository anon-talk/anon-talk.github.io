## Vision

Welcome to **Project: AnonTalk**! This is a personal project born from a love for beautiful design and cool, thematic user experiences. The goal is not to create another secure messaging app, but to build a unique chat website for my friend group that *feels* like a secret agent's secure communication terminal.

The core mission is to create an immersive aesthetic defined as **"secret agent hacking the Pentagon."** The focus is on a professional, minimalist, and mysterious UI/UX, with all "encryption" being purely for visual effect.

## Core Experience (MVP)

*   **Cosmetic Encryption:** All messages are displayed with a cool encrypted effect by default. This is not for real security, but for the aesthetic!
*   **Tactile Decryption:** Users can reveal the plaintext of a message by `hovering` on desktop or `tapping` an icon on mobile.
*   **Thematic Animations:** The decryption process uses unique, themed animations based on the cipher used (e.g., a "Decryption Scramble" for the Caesar Cipher).
*   **Anonymous Agent IDs:** Users are assigned random, anonymous usernames (e.g., `Operator_7`) to maintain the clandestine vibe.
*   **Hidden Admin Powers:** A secret "God Mode" is built-in for the project administrator.

## Tech Stack (How it Actually Works)

This project is an exploration of what can be built with a modern, serverless architecture. It is **not** truly peer-to-peer.

*   **Frontend:** A static website built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. All coding is heavily assisted by AI models.
*   **Backend & Real-time Sync:** **Firebase Realtime Database** is used to store messages and provide real-time updates between clients.
*   **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication** handles all user sign-up and login.
*   **Hosting:** The entire static site is hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.
*   **Design:** All UI/UX is designed in **Figma**.

## Project Management

All tasks, feature ideas, and bug reports are tracked on our **GitHub Project board**. Please refer to it for the current development roadmap and to-do list.
