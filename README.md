## Vision

Project: AnonTalk is an exploration of what a chat application can feel like. It prioritizes atmosphere, user experience, and a unique visual identity over a broad feature set. The core experience is built around cosmetic encryption, anonymous agent IDs, and a professional, minimalist "hacker terminal" aesthetic.

This project is currently in the design and early development phase.

## Core Features (MVP)

*   **Encrypted by Default:** All messages are displayed in an encrypted format.
*   **Hold/Tap-to-Decrypt:** A tactile interaction for revealing plaintext messages.
*   **Thematic Decryption Effects:** Unique reveal animations tied to the chosen cipher (Caesar, Atbash, etc.).
*   **Anonymous Agent IDs:** Users are assigned random, anonymous usernames for use on the network.
*   **Admin "God Mode":** A hidden administrative backdoor for the project owner.
*   **Unique UI/UX:** A custom-designed interface built from the ground up to feel like a professional, secure communication tool.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Realtime Database for messaging and Firebase Authentication for user management.
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.

## Status

This repository is the future home of the ANONTALK web application. The design is being finalized in Figma, and development will begin shortly.
